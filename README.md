These programs are modified version of examples from: https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing

Check those out for more information of requierments for Kinect v1 and v2.

Also remember to modify the directory variable for each take, so the images won't all save in the same folders.

DISCLAIMER: the Kinect v2 version has not been tested.
