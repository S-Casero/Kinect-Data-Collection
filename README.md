# Kinect-Data-Collection

These programs are modified version of examples from: https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing

Check those out for more information of requierments for Kinect v1 and v2.

Also remember to modify the directory variable for each take, so the images won't all save in the same folders.

If we read the following papaer: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308615218_Comparison_of_Kinect_v1_and_v2_Depth_Images_in_Terms_of_Accuracy_and_Precision

It recomends the use of Kinect v2, but requiering a lot of preprocessing on the images due to noise, while Kinect v1 won't need that much processing it doesn't offer the same accuracy.

DISCLAIMER: the Kinect v2 version has not been tested.
